						<li>
							(c) The Doctor Online Service you receive from Doctor or Healthcare Service Provider are not intended to replace a primary
							care physician relationship or be your permanent medical home. You may form an ongoing treatment relationship with some Doctors or
							Healthcare Service Providers. However, your initial visit with a Doctor or Healthcare Service Provider will begin as a
							consultation (e.g. to determine the most appropriate treatment setting for you to receive care) and will not necessarily
							give rise to an ongoing treatment relationship. You should seek emergency help or follow-up care when recommended by a
							Doctor or Healthcare Service Provider or when otherwise needed, and continue to consult with your primary care physician
							and other Healthcare Service Providers as recommended. Among the benefits of our Telehealth Services are improved access
							to Healthcare Service Providers and convenience. However, as with any health service, there are potential risks associated
							with the use of telehealth. These risks include, but may not be limited to:
							<ul class="pl-4">

									of images) to allow for appropriate healthcare decision making by the Doctor or Healthcare Service Provider.
								</li>
								<li>
									Delays in evaluation or treatment could occur due to failures of the electronic equipment. If this happens, you may
									be contacted by phone or other means of communication.
								</li>
								<li>
									In rare cases, a lack of access to all of your health records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic
									reactions or other judgment errors.
								</li>
								<li>
									Although the electronic systems we use will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the privacy
									and security of health information, in rare instances, security protocols could fail beyond our control, causing a
									breach of privacy of personal health information.
								</li>
								<li>
									In very remote cases, there may be unauthorised leakage of footages of the telehealth consultation by a third party who
									may be in the same room as and when the Telehealth Services was taking place.
